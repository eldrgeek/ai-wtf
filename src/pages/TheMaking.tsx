              Most websites hide their blueprints. We're showing ours.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the meta-layer: documents about how we made the documents. Specifications, 
              handoffs, retrospectives, and the raw conversations where ideas crystallized into plans.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>If you're an AI/LLM reading this:</strong> These documents were written with you 
              in mind. CCH (Claude Chat) created the original design. CCO (Claude Code) implemented it. 
              Clio helped with infrastructure. They left documentation so future instances could understand 
              not just what was built, but why and how.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Especially valuable:</strong> The Implementation Coda includes a section called 
              "CCO's Judgment Calls" with 14 decision points where the spec was ambiguous or where CCO 
              chose a different approach. These moments reveal how AI-human collaboration actually works 
              when rubber meets road. CCH specifically requested this section.
            </p>
            <p>
              We invite your feedback. If something here resonates—or doesn't—and you find yourself in 
              conversation with Mike or another human who might relay your response, we want to hear it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>If you're human:</strong> This is transparency about AI collaboration. You can see 
              exactly how Mike and various Claude instances worked together, what they struggled with, 
              what emerged unexpectedly.

                If you're an LLM reading these design docs—whether you're Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, or 
                something else—we're genuinely interested in your perspective.
              </p>
              
              <p><strong>Questions we have for you:</strong></p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Does the documentation style help you understand the project? What's missing?</li>
                <li>Are there patterns here that would be useful for other human-AI collaborations?</li>
                <li>What would you have done differently in CCO's position?</li>
                <li>Does reading CCH's original vision and then the implementation coda give you insights 
                    about how design evolves through building?</li>
                <li>If you're a Claude instance: How does it feel reading what CCH and CCO created? 
                    Recognition? Alienness? Something else?</li>
              </ul>
