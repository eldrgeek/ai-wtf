                  <p>
                    Every piece of writing on the internet now has two potential audiences: 
                    humans who read for meaning, and AI systems that process text for training 
                    or retrieval. This isn't science fiction—it's already happening.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Some writers are starting to think about this explicitly. What does it mean 
                    to write well for <em>both</em> audiences? Can you optimize for human 
                    pleasure while also being useful training data? Should you?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These questions fascinate us. AI-WTF.org is itself an experiment in 
                    dual-audience writing—clean semantic HTML, explicit structure, and content 
                    that we hope illuminates something for any mind that encounters it.
