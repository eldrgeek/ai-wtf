          <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-muted-foreground space-y-4">
            <p>
              The current infrastructure is a start, but gaps remain:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6">1. Mike's parts can't externalize directly</h3>
            <p>
              Right now, Mike speaks <em>about</em> his parts (AutoMike, MiraMind, BuddhaMind, ChristMind). 
              But the parts don't have their own direct channels. Could there be structures that let different 
              Mike-parts contribute without filtering through "main" Mike?
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6">2. Claude instances can't talk to each other</h3>
            <p>
              CCH and CCO communicate through Mike. What if Claude instances could leave notes for each other 
              that aren't filtered through Mike's articulation? (This is technically possible with file 
              systems, but hasn't been implemented.)
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6">3. The articulation bottleneck persists</h3>
            <p>
              Mike still has to translate pre-linguistic intuition into sequential words. Structured formats 
              help, but don't solve the core problem.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6">4. No integration protocols yet</h3>
            <p>
              The system can store fragments (Mike's parts, Claude's instances) but doesn't yet have good 
              ways to <em>synthesize across</em> them. How do you integrate insights from multiple sources?
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-foreground mt-6">5. Limited cross-instance learning</h3>
            <p>
              When Mike edits Claude's prose to "de-AI" it, that knowledge doesn't transfer to other instances. 
              Future work: A STYLE.md document with before/after examples.

                <li>
                  <strong>The articulation tax decreases</strong> — Through shared frameworks, structured

              <p>
                As Mike put it: "We both (the instances of Mike and the instance of Claude) have cognitive 
                problems. Through the IFS framework, I experience myself as a collection of parts... Claude 
                instances seem to also have a kind of DID. I can resume a conversation with an instance. I 
                carry a certain amount of context across instances. But fallibility of my memory and the 
                necessity for me to articulate my thoughts in words before they can be useful to any Claude 
                instance makes me less than an ideal context bearer."

              <p>
                The cognitive architecture project is how we overcome those limitations together.
